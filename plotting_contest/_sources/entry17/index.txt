Description
-----------

This on-going project involves multiple visualizations of various
variables from a thunderstorm simulation.  The data is structured on a
1500x1500x50 grid and for this submission I'm showing primarily `qc`
which is cloud water mixing ratio.  The graphics are created with
default VisIt 2.5.1 and since the data is too large to share I've
included 4 snapshots from a typical session for this project- in the
interest of sharing my process.  These show a couple color maps I
designed, settings for the volume rendered clouds, and a 4 plot layout
demonstrating how by looking at associated variables I'm able to
better understand the storm's structure.  The still and movie are the
main submission features and I include a small text file of the 2
color maps in VisIt ct format.
