Visualization of MCMC chains (walkers; left panels) and derived
posterior probability distributions (right panels) for four parameters
in the specified dark matter halo potential model. The model is
evaluated against simulated observations of RR Lyrae in the
Sagittarius stream. Steps -150 to 0 were considered burn-in and
rejected from the displayed posteriors.
