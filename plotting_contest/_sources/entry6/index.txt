Research and motivation
-----------------------

I've been looking after some visualization tools for social networks
in order to present a visual representation of the the Atepassar
social network, helping me to see how the users are connected and
visualize the friendships between them.

AtePassar is a famous educational Brazilian social network for
students all around Brazil that study for exams to get a civil public
job. Nowadays I work for as a scientist chief responsible of creating
and bringing collective intelligence to improve the features of the
website. I was performing some analysis over the social network and
how the students interacted. So I decided to create a new
visualization that showed how geography and political borders affected
where students lived relative to their friends.

The social network snapshot was taken on March, 2013 has more than 200k
users from several cities of the country.
