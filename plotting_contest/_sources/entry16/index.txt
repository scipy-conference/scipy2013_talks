Description

My first submission got me inspired to do something I've always wanted
to: make my own Unknown Pleasures album cover.

I consider this one of the most aesthetic and iconic scientific plots
and to be able to reproduce something similar in 89 lines of Python
(of which only 36 really count!) is a real thrill.

For fun you can also substitute the B1919+21 pulsar used for the
original cover with a pulsar of your choice from the online EPN
archive, just to be different!
