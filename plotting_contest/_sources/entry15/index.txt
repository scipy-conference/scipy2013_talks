Description
-----------

We made the attached visualization of a molecular dynamics simulation
of a valence hopping around a lattice; it wasn't obvious how to
visualize this data.  We used the rainbow colors not only for
aesthetics but to show the trajectory of the valence and to highlight
the jumps from one point in the lattice to another -- the path goes
from red to orange to yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, magenta.

[Editor's Note: the data file is over 600MB, so it is not included
here.]

There is a little bit about the visualization here:

And some more context about the molecular dynamics simulations here:

Thank you for the opportunity to share our visualization using Python
and matplotlib with the SciPy community!
