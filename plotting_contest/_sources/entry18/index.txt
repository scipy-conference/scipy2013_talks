Description

The image depicts a Runge-Kutta ODE solver against a time adaptive
Runge-Kutta ODE solver, as applied to the Lorenz equations. The
corresponding IPython notebook is attached that produced the
figure. The motivation for this work was to highlight the differences
between these solvers during a homework in a nonlinear dynamics course
that I am currently taking.
