\caption*{3D projection of the oxygen-rich ejecta in the supernova remnant N132D, as seen from the Earth. Oxygen emission is in blue and yellow, hydrogen in red, and chopped-off foreground stars are marked by black spheres. Oxygen-rich knots that were expelled from the outer layers of the progenitor star during the supernova explosion are identified as the hydrogen-free clumps. The axes are in parsec, where 1 pc $\cong$ 3.1$\times10^{13}$ km . The ejecta form a distorted ring structure, best revealed in an animation of this 3D map. \textbf{In the electronic version of this figure, an interactive 3D model can be loaded by clicking on the image} (Adobe Acrobat Reader v.9.0 or above is required). \textbf{In addition, an animation of the 3D map is stored in an \emph{augmented reality layer} accessible by snapping a picture of this figure with a smartphone and using the Layar app}.
