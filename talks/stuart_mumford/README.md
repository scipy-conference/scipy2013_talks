Abstract : 
----------

Modern solar physicists have, at their disposal, an abundance of space and
ground based instruments providing a large amount of data to analyse the
complex Sun every day. The NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite, for
example, collects around 1.2 TB of data every 24 hours which requires extensive
reconstruction before it is ready for scientific use. Currently most data
processing and analysis for all solar data is done using IDL and the
“SolarSoft” library. SunPy is a project designed to provide a free, open and
easy-to-use Python alternative to IDL and SolarSoft.
SunPy provides unified, coordinate-aware data objects for many common solar
data types and integrates into these plotting and analysis tools. Providing
this base will give the global solar physics community the opportunity to use
Python for future data processing and analysis routines. The astronomy and
astrophysics community, through the implementation and adoption of AstroPy and
pyRAF, have already demonstrated that Python is well suited for the analysis
and processing of space science data. 
In this presentation, we give key examples of SunPy’s structure and scope, as
well as the major improvements that have taken place to provide a stable base
for future expansion. We discuss recent improvements to file I/O and
visualisation, as well as improvements to the structure and interface of the
map objects.
We discuss the many challenges which SunPy faces if it is to achieve its goal
of becoming a key package for solar physics. The SunPy developers hope to
increase the the visibility and uptake of SunPy, and encourage people to
contribute to the project, while maintaining a high quality code base, which is
facilitated by the use of a social version control system (git and GitHub).
