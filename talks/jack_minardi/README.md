Abstract : 
----------

I will walk the audience through all the steps necessary for acquiring sensor data using a Raspberry Pi
and streaming it over a network to be plotted live. I will also explain how to control an actuator like
a servo motor.

**The topics I will cover:**

* Basic circuits (V = I * R)
* GPIO Pins
* Pulse width modulation
* Analog to digital converters
* Serial communication (SPI)
* Basic data streaming using zmq
* Basic real time plots using chaco
* All the python needed for the above topics

By the end of the talk I will demonstrate sensor and actuator control using everything that was covered.
