Abstract :
----------

LSST is an upcoming dedicated 8.4-meter survey telescope that will
image the entire visible sky twice a week.  We're building the
software system for LSST using a combination of C++ and Python, and in
this talk I'll go over some of the advantages and disadvantages of
that combination, and some of the tricks we've learned to make them
play well together, at least in the case of astronomical data
analysis.
