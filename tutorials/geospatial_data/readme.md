Description :
-------------

Geographically referenced data is important in many scientific fields,
and working with spatial data has become widespread in other domains
as well (e.g. Google Maps, geolocated tweets, 4square
checkins). Python has become an increasingly important language for
working with geospatial data. In this tutorial, students will get
experience in working with common geospatial formats in open source
python libraries.

Python bindings are available for (nearly) all the standard libraries
for working with geospatial data (proprietary and open source). Some
of these libraries (including PROJ.4 and GDAL) are used in this
tutorial, along with more "pythonic" packages for accessing them, such
as Shapely and Fiona. PostGIS, an extension to PostgreSQL, is briefly
touched on, as are python scripting extensions to Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) packages such as QGIS and ArcGIS.

This tutorial should be accessible to anyone who has a basic
understanding of NumPy and matplotlib.
