For most types of "conversational" data analysis problems, using
Unix tools interactively is a superior alternative to downloading
data files into a spreadsheet application (e.g. Excel) or writing
one-shot custom scripts. The technique is to use combinations of
standard Unix tools and a very small number of general purpose
Python scripts. This allows one to accomplish much more than might
seem possible, especially with tabular data.

Audience: Scientists who use Unix but are not Unix administrators
or authors of hardcore Unix-specific software. These people may
aspire to write scripts in Unix or to improve the scripts they
write.
