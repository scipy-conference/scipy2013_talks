Abstract :
----------

The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched in July 1999 and continues
to make a wide range of astronomical discoveries. A unique capability
of Chandra is the extraordinary spatial resolution of of the X-ray
images, made possible by the X-ray optics and a sophisticated attitude
determination system that reconstructs the detected photons into a
sharp image.

In order to fully track the performance of the attitude system, the
operations team at the Chandra X-ray Center has developed a
Python-based infrastructure named Mica. Mica includes a component
which aggregates diverse engineering and science data products, and a
component which provides tools to mine these aggregated data to assist
in data trending and visualization as well as anomaly investigation.

In this poster we will discuss some of the issues facing the Chandra
satellite as it nears its 14th birthday, and then describe the
architecture of Mica and show examples of how it has been used in
practice.
