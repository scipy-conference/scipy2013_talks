Abstract : 
----------

HTSQL is a high-level navigational query language and web-service gateway used by medical researchers to answer complex data inquiries in a clinical setting. HTSQL has been in development for 7 years and in the forthcoming 2.4 release adds a really superb ETL translation mechanism to handle integration of related data-sets and the construction of derived databases. This poster will introduce HTSQL and review its broad applicability to scientific computing.
